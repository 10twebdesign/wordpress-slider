# WordPress Slider
Easy to maintain WordPress image slider. Slider is fully responsive and works well on most any device.

## Requirements
WordPress Slider requires your WordPress theme support post thumbnails / featured images. Instructions for enabling can be found on the WordPress Codex (https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Thumbnails).

## Installation

For Automatic Updates (Recommended):
* Download, install, and activate the GitHub Updater Plugin at https://github.com/afragen/github-updater
* From your WordPress installation, navigate to Settings - GitHub Updater - Install Plugin.
* Put the Plugin URI (https://github.com/10twebdesign/wordpress-slider) in the so labeled field and click Install Plugin.
* Activate, configure, and enjoy.

Using Upload method:
* Download the latest version at https://github.com/10twebdesign/wordpress-slider/archive/master.zip

## Credit Where Credit Is Due
* WordPress Slider uses the fantastic 'slick' carousel by Ken Wheeler. You can find it on GitHub at https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/.
* I highly recommend using Andy Fragen's github-updater to install this plugin to your WordPress installation, so that you will get any updates automatically.
